# Frontend JavaScript Events

### Exercise 1
Create an HTML file with a button. Using Javascript, once the button is clicked use the array below to change the color of the background to the corresponding index. The colors do not have to start over once the last color is reached.

``` ["blue", "red", "yellow", "brown", "orange", "purple", "black", "green"]  ```

##### Challenge:
Make the colors recycle once the last color is reached.


### Exercise 2
Use the included HTML file ```index.html``` to do the following exercise using `classList` instead of javascript inline styling. Make any necessary CSS definitions in a stylesheet.

1) Make all inputs have a 3px red border
2) Give everything with the class `hello` a white background
3) Give the element with id `special` a 2px solid blue border(pick your own rgb blue)

##### Challenge:
Make all the `<p>` tags that are nested inside of `divs` 25px font(font-size: 25px)
